            server-side scripting, enabling scalable and real-time applications
            with its event-driven architecture. MongoDB, a NoSQL database,
            complements Node.js by providing flexible data storage and powerful
            querying capabilities, ideal for handling large volumes of data in
            modern web applications.

                interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Developed and
                maintained by Facebook, it allows developers to create reusable
                UI components,making code more modular and easier to manage.
                React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render
                components, improving performance.

                Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run
                JavaScript code outside the browser, leveraging Google's V8
                JavaScript engine. It is known for its event-driven,
                non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for
                building scalable network applications. Node.js is highly
                suitable for real-time applications and APIs due to its
                asynchronous nature, enabling handling of many connections
                simultaneously.
